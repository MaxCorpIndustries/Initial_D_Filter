# Initial_D_Filter
This repository is meant to store my work on converting several reshade filters into one big initial D filter reshade in Assetto Corsa


----------------------!! DISCLAIMER !!----------------------


The purpose of this """" shader """" is to essentially compile several of the shaders that get offered to be installed when reshade is installed.

Rather than sharing a general preset .ini file, I've found that I can instead fine tune these shaders, their value limits, and the png files they use to 
make a specialized "shader" in the Reshade menu that will generate a better "initial D" manga comic style then I could do with the default settings in these shaders.
